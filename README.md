This project include python scripts and TopSpin layouts for graphic report. For python script, please download and put them into "(...TopSpin_DIR)\exp\stan\nmr\py\user". For layout files, please download and put them into "(...TopSpin_DIR)\plot\layouts". You can also create your own layout, and change their name as "H.xwp" and "C.xwp".

The script to generate report:
1."apl": To generate the graphic report for current spectrum (1H or 13C).
2."apl_dir": To generate the graphic reports for all 1H/13C spcetrum in current directory.
3."str": To generate the string report for current spectrum (1H or 13C).
4."str_dir": To generate the string reports for all 1H/13C spcetrum in current directory.
5."arp": To generate both string reports and graphic report for all 1H/13C spcetrum in current directory.

To run script above, just input script name on command line, and Enter. Before running scrupts, you have to mark the integrations and peaks for your spectrums manually. 

My script was tested under TopSpin 4.0 (It should be work on other version). For any question about the scripts, please feel free to let me know :)
