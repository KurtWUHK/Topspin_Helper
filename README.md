This project include two python scripts and two TopSpin layouts. To use them, you have to download and put the scripts into "(...TopSpin_DIR)\exp\stan\nmr\py\user". And put the layout files into "(...TopSpin_DIR)\plot\layouts". You can also create your own layout, and change their name as "H.xwp" and "C.xwp".

Open your spectrum by TopSpin. Before generating report, you have to process your spectrum manually. Especially, the peaks must be picked.

Enter "apl" on command line, the graphic report will be generated on the directory where your spectrum is.

Furthermore, you can enter "apl_dir" to generate all 1H and 13C spectrum on current directory automatically, it may take some time, don't close TopSpin until the software tell you "apl_dir.py: finished" on right-bottom.

Currently, this project support 1H and 13C spectrum. For any question about the scripts, please feel free to let me know :)
